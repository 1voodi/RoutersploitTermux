I make the script to install routersploit on termux.
I get the resolve of many problem installing termux in 
https://github.com/threat9/routersploit/issues/531

I just simplified and fix the command so it will take less storage 

This is the way to install this script
```
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install git figlet
git clone https://github.com/41Team/RoutersploitTermux
cd RoutersploitTermux
bash run.sh
```
It will take time about +30min 

Thank you to use my script (If occured a error or fail just send a issue) :)
