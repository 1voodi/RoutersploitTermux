I make the script to install routersploit on termux.
I get the resolve of many problem installing termux in 
https://github.com/threat9/routersploit/issues/531

I just simplified and fix the command so it will take less storage 

This is the way to install this script

1.apt update && apt upgrade

2.apt install git figlet

3.git clone https://github.com/41Team/RoutersploitTermux

4.cd RoutersploitTermux

5.bash run.sh

It will take time about +30min 

Thank you to use my script (If occured a error or fail just send a issue)
